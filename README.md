### Julia-Unicode

This is a simple package to insert Unicode characters to Julia as in Julia REPL.
The list of unicodes is copied from [Julia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/base/latex_symbols.jl). For some reasons, [Julia Completions](https://github.com/jakeconnor/JuliaCompletions) doesn't quite work for me and [UnicodeMath](https://github.com/mvoidex/UnicodeMath) keymaping is different from Julia (e.g., `\epsilon` and `\varepsilon`), so I created this package. 

#### Usage:

Type `\alpha` and hit enter/tab to insert the corresponding unicode `Î±` to Sublime Text. Similar to other unicodes.

#### Known issues:

It is known that there is a bug in handling superscriptions, e.g., `\^2`. I have no plan to fix them for now.
