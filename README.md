### Julia UTF-8

This is a simple package to insert Unicode charectors to Julia as in Julia REPL.
The list of unicodes is copied from [Julia Completion](https://github.com/jakeconnor/JuliaCompletions). For some reasons, it doesn't quite work for me, so I created this. 

#### Usage:

Typing `\alpha` and pressing enter/tab will insert the corresponding unicode `Î±` to Sublime Text.
